Music >> is a social media hub for musicians to better market their music through multiple social
media platforms, all in one spot. 

Main objective: Tie all social media activity for musicians, push their tracks/images to those sites 

Milestones:
1. Make sure all api's are both functional and will allow for cross-platform activity 
    a. scope: study the spotify api first, make sure to have a basic site running with songs that
    can be played. 
    b. requirements: figure out how the artist can create original playlists for their music and add it to the
    page dynamically.
    c. scope: study both facebook and twitter's api and make sure that there are no restrictions on usage. Then, tie in those api's into the code so that the site is now a hub for musicians to push their spotify marketing easily and in one place. Also, add an original chatroom so artists can communicate with their fans in real time. 
    d. requirements: figure out all requirements for twitter and facebook api's to work. also see if direct messaging is possible after user has authorized the app to access their accounts. 
2. Figure out how OAuth will work with this application 
3. Learning Angular to make this a one-page application 
    a. scope: learning typescript to both simplify syntax and meet the two new technologies/libraries requirement. also learn the full meaning of what a one-page application is and how it all ties together with the components.
    b. requirements: watch angular 4 tutorial that I purchased and work at least 2 hours on this specific subject every day until I'm comfortable creating the application, written entirely in typescript and made with angular.  
4. Pie in the sky: Make the app mobile with angular's 'ionic' framework for mobile applications (angular's version of react native)
    a. scope: try to transfer as much of the code for the regular application to the mobile one as possible. Then, figure out how the differences in syntax matter/apply to the issue at hand and adapt accordingly.
    b. requirements: read as much of the ionic documentation as possible

    Sprint 1: 
    Complexity 1: Set up a server. 
    Complexity 2: Read Spotify documentation. 
    Complexity 3: Render a page with a spotify playlist, of any kind.
    Complexity 5: Start learning Angular.
    Complexity 2: Read Twitter and Facebook documentation. 
    Complexity 3: Create an MVC framework with multiple pages including a sign in page which includes
    OAuth functionality for social media authentication.
    Complexity 3: Create and finish front-end style(css, possibly sass in next sprint)
    Complexity 5: Start learning typescript.


    Backlog: 
    Complexity 1: Find useful icons for front end design.
    Complexity 1: Decide on color scheme.
    Complexity 1: Create app for spotify and grab access token/secret.
    Complexity 3: Test oAuth functionality for spotify.
    Complexity 2: Test playlist functionality.
    Complexity 3: Test sign-in page
    Complexity 8: Create and test demo page for angular version of the site
